This directory contains some code that I wrote using a mix of gpt-4 and gpt-3.5  

Up until this point this is the first time that I've integrated some generative model code into a project.  

Given the uneasy providence of the data used for training, and other issues with simply aiming to retain some modicum of a grip on reality, I haven't been super inclined to use these models much.  

However, what you find in this directory, is rather unglamorous code for me to write.  Lots of slogging through the finer points of dearimgui and templates and whatnot.  

This process made some things easier, and also some things much harder, and the real test will now be to integrate into the simulation software.  

In anycase, what you find here at the initial commit is what a fairly untrained LLM user did in a day or two.

# Geometry Processing Starter Kit

This project serves as a starter kit for developing geometry processing applications. It provides a basic structure for managing application state, GUI interactions, file parsing, and data serialization. The code in this repository was generated with the assistance of an AI-based code generation tool.

## Overview

The starter kit includes the following components:

- `AppState.cpp` and `AppState.h`: Implementations and headers for application state management.
- `Events.h`: Header defining custom event types.
- `FieldView.cpp` and `FieldView.h`: Implementations and headers for field view management.
- `FileParser.cpp` and `FileParser.h`: Implementations and headers for file parsing.
- `GUIContext.cpp` and `GUIContext.h`: Implementations and headers for GUI context management.
- `ImGuiWidgets.cpp` and `ImGuiWidgets.h`: Implementations and headers for custom ImGui widgets.
- `MyConfig.cpp` and `MyConfig.h`: Implementations and headers for application configuration.
- `Serialization.cpp` and `Serialization.h`: Implementations and headers for data serialization.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Code Generation

The code in this repository was generated with the assistance of an AI-based code generation tool. The tool helps automate the generation of boilerplate code, such as headers, implementations, and basic functionality, to accelerate the development process.

## Usage

To use this starter kit, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.
2. Modify the code in the relevant files to suit your specific geometry processing application needs.
3. Build and run your application.

## Dependencies

The starter kit may have dependencies on external libraries or frameworks, depending on your specific use case. Please refer to individual files or documentation for more information on dependencies.

## Contributing

If you find issues or have suggestions for improving this starter kit, please feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests or reporting issues.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You are free to use and modify this code for your own projects.
